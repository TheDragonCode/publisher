# Release Publisher

This package was intended to make it easy to release a release to GitHub from the command line.

At the same time, the script should automatically read the list of commits since the previous release, process it, group and receive data on fixes, changes, additions and deletions.

But GitHub recently added a charm and this package is no longer needed. Of course, we can update and improve it ... for a subscription ... And so, we transfer the project to the archive.
